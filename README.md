Introduction

The Voice-Based Email project is designed to address the communication
challenges faced by visually challenged individuals while accessing and managing their email accounts. The project aims to provide a solution that
enables visually challenged individuals to compose, send, and manage their
emails using their voices1. The project utilizes the SpeechRecognition library in Python to convert the user’s voice into text and send emails using
the smtplib library.

This project has several key features, including voice input, text-to-speech,
and speech-to-text functionalities and also partially converts to a regional
language (Malayalam). The project allows visually challenged individuals
to compose emails using their voice and transcribes the received emails into
speech for the user to listen to. The project also enables the user to send
emails using their voice by transcribing the user’s voice into text. Additionally, the project includes accessibility features, such as user-friendly interfaces
and error-handling mechanisms.

The Voice-Based Email project provides several benefits to visually challenged individuals, such as increased independence in accessing and managing
their email accounts. The project allows visually challenged individuals to
compose and send emails with ease, improving their communication abilities.
The project’s text-to-speech feature makes it easier for visually challenged
individuals to listen to their emails, enhancing their user experience and
making the email communication process more accessible and inclusive.
